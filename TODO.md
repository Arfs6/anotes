# TODO  

This list isn't in any specific order. At this point, I will be updating the file (adding / removing todo items) regularly, but as the project grows, this will change. I am thinking of updating the todo once every quarter.  

- [  ] Make better command line arguments and errors.  
- [  ] Versions. Look for a way to version notes.py.  
- [x] Add ginja templates to customize how the notes looks like.  
- [  ] Improve README.  
- [  ] Add support for uploading notes to github.  
- [x] Use pandoc to convert the markdown and latex files to html.  
- [ ] Add flag to edit note after creation.
